            RayTracer is a robust 3D rendering engine implementing advanced features such as diffuse and mirror surfaces, indirect lighting, and efficient ray-mesh intersection using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). Designed to produce high-quality and realistic visualizations, the project demonstrates the power of ray tracing techniques.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diffuse and Mirror Surfaces</strong>: Simulates realistic surface properties with support for reflections up to five bounces.</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect Lighting</strong>: Incorporates global illumination with recursive light bounces for enhanced realism.</li>
            <li><strong>Antialiasing</strong>: Reduces jagged edges by casting multiple rays per pixel and averaging results for smoother images.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadows</strong>: Implements direct lighting with shadows for realistic scene depth and clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Ray-Mesh Intersection with BVH</strong>: Optimizes ray tracing performance by quickly eliminating non-intersecting objects in complex scenes.</li>
        </ul>
