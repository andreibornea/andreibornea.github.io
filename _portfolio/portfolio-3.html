            ClosedFish is a cutting-edge chess engine designed to improve upon Stockfish by introducing specialized strategies for closed positions. It evaluates a "closedness coefficient" for each chessboard state, dynamically switching between the Stockfish engine and the ClosedFish algorithm for optimal performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Closedness Coefficient Framework</strong>: Designed a "closedness coefficient" system to evaluate the positional state of the board and dynamically adapt strategies for closed positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Specialized Heuristics</strong>: Developed heuristics to assess pawn structures, piece mobility, and long-term planning for closed scenarios, addressing the limitations of traditional chess engines in such situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization</strong>: Improved the efficiency of alpha-beta pruning to better handle the computational demands of deep closed position evaluations.</li>
            <li><strong>Neural Network Integration</strong>: Contributed to integrating an NNUE-based evaluation layer to enhance the engineâ€™s ability to make accurate decisions in both closed and open board states.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Engine Switching</strong>: Helped implement a mechanism to seamlessly alternate between Stockfish and ClosedFish algorithms based on the closedness coefficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Collaboration</strong>: Collaborated with a 10-member team to integrate features, debug issues, and refine performance for various chess scenarios.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            First, clone the repository and ensure all submodules are cloned. This includes the Stockfish engine and vcpkg dependencies.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/closedfish/closedfish.git
cd closedfish</code></pre>

        <p>
            Next, download the NNUE data file by navigating to the Stockfish directory and running the following command:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">cd external/stockfish/src
make net</code></pre>

        <p>
            (Optional) Compile the Stockfish project for a standard and portable configuration:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">make -j build ARCH=x86-64</code></pre>

        <p>
            Navigate back to the main project directory and configure the build using CMake:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ../../..
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</code></pre>

        <p>
            Finally, build the project to generate the executable:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">cmake --build build</code></pre>

        <p>
            Once the build is complete, locate the compiled binary, which should be available at:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">build/app/Debug/Executable.exe</code></pre>

        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>Comprehensive project documentation is generated using Doxygen and hosted online at: <a href="https://closedfish-docs.netlify.app/" target="_blank">ClosedFish Documentation</a>.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Once the project is built, you can use the compiled executable to analyze or play chess games. Example usage:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">./Executable --analyze --game "example_game.pgn"</code></pre>
